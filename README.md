# Mission to Mars
Gathering information on the planet mars, using bootstrap, flask, splinter and mongodb.

## Summary
This project was designed as an introduction to full-stack web development with Python and MongoDB. In this project, we learn what news, facts, featured images and hemispheres Mars has through our locally-hosted site. With the functionality to scrape data, the website can retrive the most recent data, as the template is formatted with bootstrap to allow for dynamic content to be displayed on the page. The scraper pulls from various sources (see below) and compiles them all onto a single, local website. In addition, all data is stored on a local MongoDB server (requires installation), formatted to allow clean data processing.  

### Technologies Used
To accomplish this project, the following technologies had to be used:
- Python 3.7.6
- Jupyter Notebooks
- MongoDB databases

## Considerations
In the future, a greater level of css and bootstrap skills would be required to make this webapp truly high functioning. In addition, the locally-hosted webdriver could also be improved. These future fixes can add a greater level to the application, and are potential improvements to the site.
